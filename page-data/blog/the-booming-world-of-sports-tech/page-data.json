Despite professional sports being a multi-billion dollar industry, many investors expressed concern over limited market size. There are only ~120 teams across NFL, NBA, MLB, and NHL, and budgets for non-performance related initiatives (i.e. player salaries) are notoriously frugal. Furthermore, the collegiate market is highly fragmented and the sports industry as a whole is ripe with gatekeepers.","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"However, the sentiment has changed in recent years with a boon in “sports tech” investment. At a high-level, this is in large part attributed to digital transformation. The reason NFL and NBA teams routinely sell for $2B+ is due to massively lucrative broadcast television deals.
