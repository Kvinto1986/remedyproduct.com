For me, exploring a new city on foot and engaging with its local culture was what really made the experiences memorable, but it was pretty hard to know what areas of a city were worth exploring. Existing travel websites and books were great at outlining a city’s history and pointing out the tourist landmarks or the hottest restaurants, but really fell short on interesting ways to actually explore. So for quite a while I was just showing up in a new city, checking into a hostel, and talking to people who had been there for a few days and then just sketching out on a paper map where I wanted to go. While that approach worked ok, I felt it would be a lot better if that kind of information was readily available online so I could better plan out where to go and where to stay…and that’s how walkli was born.","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Iggy: What made you decide to apply to MassChallenge?","spans":[{"start":0,"end":53,"type":"strong"}]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Jeff: First, unlike friends and family, the judges from MassChallenge provide unbiased feedback on your company. In some ways, applying and getting in was external validation that we weren’t doing something crazy. But more than that, MassChallenge provides and opportunity to work alongside more than 100 other startups, have access to mentors with relevant industry experience, and get exposure to potential investors. Also, unlike many other accelerators, there is no cost and they take no equity so really there wasn’t a downside to applying.","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Iggy: What was the application process like?","spans":[{"start":0,"end":44,"type":"strong"}]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Jeff: Tough! The first round involved a long written application covering everything from team member backgrounds, to customer pain points, to the competitive landscape. You were only given between 250 and 500 characters for each response, so it took a lot of effort to pare down our answers to concisely cover the key points.
