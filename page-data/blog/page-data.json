Yet, this year workout options look very different. As the pandemic reaches month 9 in the United States, many industries have been hit hard, but few have been impacted as much as fitness.

Gyms & fitness studios are no different.“ San Francisco CrossFit, one of the oldest and most influential CrossFit gyms in the world, had to close its doors in November.
