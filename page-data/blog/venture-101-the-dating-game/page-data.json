Games are often played – encouraging encounters can end in ghosting, they might like your friend (competitor) better, and you have to finely walk that “I’m available” but also “hard to get” vibe. All you can do though is stay true to yourself (and vision), and coining a phrase from the great Joel Embiid, just trust the process.

Try leveraging a relationship with one of their “friends”, as VC’s value deal flow from their respective peers at other firms.
